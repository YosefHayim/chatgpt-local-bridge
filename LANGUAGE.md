# LANGUAGE.md — ai-browser-bridge

The human↔agent glossary: names only. Use these exact terms in code, comments,
commits, and docs; avoid the listed aliases. Orientation lives in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Terms

**Bridge**
The running tool that connects one terminal session to one ChatGPT/Gemini browser
conversation and brokers local tool calls between them.

**Conversation**
The actual browser thread — its model, messages, edits, and regenerations. Owned by
the provider, driven (not replaced) by the Bridge.
_Avoid_: chat, thread, session.

**Session**
The Bridge's own local record of one terminal-driven run (its metadata and event
log). A Session _describes_ a Conversation; it is not the Conversation.
_Avoid_: conversation, chat, history.

**Login**
The signed-in browser identity (the persisted Chrome profile). The thing that must
never leak. Distinct from a Session.
_Avoid_: session, account.

**Tunnel**
The HTTPS channel that lets ChatGPT reach the local MCP server when it cannot reach
localhost. Implemented with Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`,
`*.trycloudflare.com`).
_Avoid_: ngrok, proxy.

**Tool**
A single local capability exposed to ChatGPT over MCP — grep, read, patch, tests,
diff.
_Avoid_: command, function.

**Sandbox**
The validation boundary that confines every Tool's file access to the Target repo.
A request outside it fails loudly.
_Avoid_: jail, scope.

**Checkpoint**
A file snapshot captured around an MCP patch so the change can be rolled back.

**Provider**
One supported web-chat service (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity).
Its id, metadata, and core selectors are one entry in `config/providersConfig.ts`;
`BridgeProviderId` is the set of their ids.
_Avoid_: model, vendor, bot.

**Door**
A feature's curated `index.ts` — the only file other features import (as
`@/features/<name>`). Named re-exports of its public surface, never `export *`; its
service classes stay in `internal/`.
_Avoid_: barrel, bare index, entrypoint.

**Target repo**
The repository the Tools operate inside (`repoPath`, default `process.cwd()`). Also
where repo-local Bridge state lives, under `.bridge/`.
_Avoid_: workspace, project root.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When I `/resume` a **Session**, does it reopen the same ChatGPT
> **Conversation**?"
> **Domain expert:** "It reopens the **Conversation** in the browser and replays the
> **Session**'s event log in the terminal. The **Session** is our record; the
> **Conversation** is ChatGPT's."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "ngrok" was used to mean the **Tunnel** — resolved: the Tunnel is Cloudflare
  Tunnel (`cloudflared`); ngrok is not used anywhere.
- "session" was overloaded between the Bridge **Session** (a local run record) and
  the **Login** (the persisted browser identity) — resolved: these are distinct
  concepts.
- **PermissionMode** is the one canonical name for the `read-only | ask | auto`
  mode (derived from `PERMISSION_MODES`). `BridgePermissionMode` was a duplicate
  literal — retired.
