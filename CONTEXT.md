# CONTEXT.md — ai-browser-bridge

Orientation: what this is, its moving parts, and how they fit. For the words, see
`LANGUAGE.md`; for purpose and direction, `PROJECT.md`; for how code is written,
`CODE-STYLE.md`; for how to work in the repo, `AGENTS.md`.

## What it is

A terminal tool that drives a real ChatGPT or Gemini browser Conversation and, for
ChatGPT, exposes a narrow set of sandboxed local repo Tools to it over MCP — no raw
shell. You stay in one terminal workflow; the provider keeps its real UI.

## The four actors

| Actor | Tech | Job |
|-------|------|-----|
| **CLI** | Ink / React (`terminal/`) | Terminal UI + scriptable headless commands; one dual-mode front door. |
| **Browser** | Playwright + CDP (`providers/`) | Drives the real ChatGPT/Gemini tab behind the fixed `BrowserProvider` contract; captures responses. |
| **MCP server** | MCP SDK + Zod (`tools/`) | Exposes the local repo Tools to ChatGPT as schema-validated, Sandbox-confined handlers. |
| **Tunnel** | `cloudflared` (`tunnel/`) | Gives the local MCP server a temporary public HTTPS URL ChatGPT's connector can reach (ChatGPT only). |

Supporting features: `bridge/` (engine + orchestrator that wire it together),
`store/` (Sessions, checkpoints, logs), `domain/` (pure types, permissions, model
catalog), `user-config/` (`~/.ai-browser-bridge/` readers).

## How the pieces relate

- A **Bridge** drives one **Conversation** and records one **Session**.
- A **Session** belongs to exactly one **Target repo**.
- **Tools** run inside the **Sandbox**, scoped to the **Target repo**.
- A **Tunnel** exposes the MCP server hosting the **Tools** to the **Conversation**.
- The **Login** is shared across all Conversations; a **Session** is per-run.

## Where state lives

All Bridge state for a project is written **inside that project**, under
`<repo>/.bridge/` — `config.json`, the signed-in `chrome-profile/`, `sessions/`,
`logs/`, `checkpoints/`, `exports/`, `screenshots/`. On first use the Bridge writes
`.bridge/.gitignore` containing a single `*`, so the whole directory self-ignores
and never enters git (see `docs/adr/0001-repo-local-state.md`). User-global config
(custom commands, hooks) lives in `~/.ai-browser-bridge/`.
